## Angular CLI

To install the Angular CLI, in a terminal or command prompt type:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This may take a few minutes to install. You can now create a new Angular application by typing:

```
ng new my-app
```

`my-app` is the name of the folder for your application. This may take a few minutes to create the Angular application in TypeScript and install its dependencies.

Let's quickly run our Angular application by navigating to the new folder and typing `ng serve` to start the web server and open the application in a browser:

```
cd my-app
ng serve
```
